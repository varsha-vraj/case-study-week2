Ecommerce Data Vault — Hash Collision Handling Strategy

In this project, hash keys are generated using SHA-256 over the business keys
(such as customer_id, product_id, order_id). These hash keys act as surrogate keys
(HKs) in Hubs, Links, and Satellites to uniquely identify records in a deterministic,
repeatable way.


Hash Function Used
I used Python’s hashlib library to compute SHA-256 hashes over concatenated
business keys.

Example:
    hash_input = customer_id
    Customer_HK = SHA256(customer_id)

   

How hash collisions are handled

- SHA-256 produces a 64-character hexadecimal string (256 bits)

Mitigation Strategies in Place:

  1. Using SHA-256 (cryptographic-grade hash)
  2. Ensuring deterministic ordering and delimiter usage when hashing multiple columns
  3. Avoiding unnecessary whitespace or nulls in input fields
  4. Documented hash generation process in `dv_utils.generate_hash()`

Conclusion:

None observed during testing, even with synthetic duplicate-like keys.
